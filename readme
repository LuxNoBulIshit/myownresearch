   In this article, I explore a novel method for lateral movement within a network by leveraging the Internet Explorer DCOM object in combination with the StdRegProv WMI class. 
   The technique involves manipulating registry settings and exploiting DCOM objects to execute commands on remote systems without triggering traditional security alerts.
